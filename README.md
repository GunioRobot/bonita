Bonita: a simple PHP template manager with lofty ambitions.
===========================================================

Version 0.2: September 6, 2011.

Explanation
-----------

Bonita's templating engine lets you build templates in PHP, and very
quickly (for example) provide feeds for lists of objects, manage
POST actions with accompanying action tokens, create different 
interfaces for various devices, and so on.


Getting started
---------------

Check out <git://github.com/benwerd/bonita.git>

To use in its most basic setting, place the whole Bonita folder into
your web project and include start.php. 

More sophisticated instructions - e.g. for inclusion in plugin-based
systems, or for using multiple templates - coming soon.


Bugs and feature requests
-------------------------

Bonita uses Github's built-in issue tracker:
